## do we web ðŸ‘‹

This is an open collaborative organization, where every time you submit something, it will motivate your partner to progress together.

This organization is extremely radical, we recommend using more modern and challenging solutions when solving problems. This way, when you discover the problem again, you can dive into the project and contribute, rather than just constantly asking for feedback from the community.

Also, this organization has no language, national, religious, or skin color restrictions, as these will not exist on a universal scale(ðŸš€).

If you want to join us in learning, all you need to do is confirm that your GitHub username matches your interest. Simply send it to doweweb@gmail.com.

On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
