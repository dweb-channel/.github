## do we web 👋

这是一个开放,进步，现代化的组织。

该组织非常激进，我们建议在解决问题时使用更现代和具有挑战性的解决方案。这样，当您再次发现问题时，您可以参与项目并做出贡献，而不仅仅是向社区索取。

并且，该组织没有语言，国家，宗教或肤色限制，因为这些限制，在宇宙尺度上不存在。

您的每一次提交，都会在这个世界留下你的痕迹，探索一些前人没有探索过的领域，也是我们前进的动力。

如果您的兴趣爱好是编写代码，想加入我们，您只需要发送github用户名或者邮箱到doweweb@gmail.com。

> 世界是你们的，也是我们的，但归根结底是你们的


This is an open, progressive, modern organization.

The organization is very radical and we recommend using more modern and challenging solutions when solving problems. This way, when you find the problem again, you can participate in the project and contribute, not just asking the community for it.

Moreover, the organization has no language, country, religion or skin color restrictions, because these restrictions do not exist on the cosmic scale.

Every submission of yours will leave your traces in this world, exploring some areas that our predecessors have not explored, and it is also the driving force for us to move forward.

If your hobby is writing code and want to join us, you only need to send your github username or email to doweweb@gmail.com.

> On it everyone you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who ever was, lived out their lives.
